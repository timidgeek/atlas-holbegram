# Holbegram :camera_flash:

In this project we will be developing a mobile application using Flutter and Firebase. The given project rundown is as follows:
```
"In general, developing a mobile application is a complex and challenging task. There are many frameworks available to develop a mobile application. Android provides a native framework based on Java language and iOS provides a native framework based on Objective-C / Shift language. However, to develop an application supporting both the OS’s, we need to code in two different languages using two different frameworks. To solve this problem there is Flutter – a simple and high-performance framework based on Dart language that provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system’s canvas rather than through the native framework."
```

## Requirements: :white_check_mark:

### Create your project:

Open your command-line tool

- `flutter create holbegram`
- `cd holbegram`
- `flutter run`

Step up your Firebase

For the backend, we are going to use Firebase. Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) app development platform that provides hosted backend services such as:

- `a real-time database`
- `cloud storage `
- `authentication `
- `crash reporting` 
- `machine learning `
- `remote configuration`
- `hosting for static files`
